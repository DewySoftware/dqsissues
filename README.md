## About

Dewy's QueueSkip (DQS) is a Discord controlled automation and account monitoring suite for anarchy Minecraft.

It does more than the name implies; on top of auto queueing functionality, it provides utilities for monitoring your account and AntiAFK to keep your account online for as long as possible (up to 6 hours on 2B).

## This Repository

This repository is intended to be a public suggestion and issue tracker for DQS. It does not contain any source code or binaries, this repository's only goal is to provide a platform for DQS **issues**.
